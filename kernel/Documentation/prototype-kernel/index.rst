Prototype Kernel own documentation
==================================

The prototype-kernel project is meant for compiling kernel modules
outside the normal kernel git tree, but still using the kernels make
system.

The purpose is getting a separate git development tree for developing
and refining your kernel module or Documentation over time, before
pushing it upstream for the Linux Kernel.
